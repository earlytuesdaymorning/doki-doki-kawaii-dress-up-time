# Doki-Doki Kawaii Dress-up Time

### A tongue-in-cheek dress-up doll game, for anyone who loves being cute and also fighting and/or doing crime.

This game was made because when I was a little girl, I loved a lot of girly things as well as a lot of things that were "for boys."
Some of my favorite little games to play were dress-up dolls, and I have always been a huge fan of Batman and other superheros.
So, I decided to combine the two and make a dress-up doll game where you can put cute, girly things on some tough, manly heros or villians.

# Technologies used

Used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create. This game also used jQuery, [Rolz Dice API](https://rolz.org/help/api), and [CircleType API](https://circletype.labwire.ca/).

Here we have the play page.

- At the top is a bar with character selection buttons. You will only be able to dress one character.

- On the right of the screen is the closet. You can select these buttons to toggle the clothing your character will wear.

- Toward the bottom of the page is the fight button. Hit this button to show your character next to his nemesis, who will be dressed just as cute as yours! The dice get rolled and the two are scored on who is cutest.
